The material presented in this publication forms a small part of the incredible range and diversity of proposals and visions that our students and faculty have produced during the past academic year. This work is indicative of the School&#x2019;s commitment, as a global leader in the field, to exploring and articulating transformative ideas through the power of design. It is as important for us to share and communicate the outcome of our research and design investigations as it is to show the fertile circumstances and conditions for the making of these projects."

Platform 4 represents a selective sampling of agendas cultivated at the GSD during the last academic year, revealing a diverse mixture of projects, research, and events. Organized as a searchable database, this publication documents both site and situation at the GSD&#x2014;it is an institutional index. While Platform 4 records research trajectories from the past year, it also has the capacity to set agendas for future work. By framing a set of issues and topics, Platform 4 focuses attention towards particular areas of interest, allowing individual work to build on and contribute to a larger body of disciplinary knowledge. In that sense, the themes within this book become projective, they provide frameworks for future inquiry."

As a rule, their colours, forms, surface qualities and structures also have an impact on the appearance of the interiors. In this issue we present buildings with a range of exceptional facades, some of which frame views, while others exploit contrasts or have moving or movable components. At the Allianz Headquarters in Wallisellen, Switzerland, the supple fabric used in the curtains within the closed cavity facade is a foil to the regularity of the glazing. The curtains endow the office spaces with a &#x201C;liveable&#x201D; atmosphere. In another project, the finely articulated cast iron elements of a London shop facade ennoble an existing brick building. And at a residence near Munich, the coarse stucco surfaces and wood-clad cut-outs are composed in a manner that causes the inside and outside realms to become interlocked."

Light is revealed to the human eye through interactions  with  material,  while  material  visually exists only in the presence of light. This interdependence between material and light, form and intangible  atmospheres,  defines  the  visual  environments we inhabit."

Through the analysis of case studies, of essays written by experienced professionals and participating students, together with projects designed as a group at the course, we will explore the real demand and agenda of education in architectural and engineering design today, and also how to train experts to learn know how to collaborate be-tween the two disciplines."

DETAIL 1/2015 contains examples of roofs that have striking spatial forms both externally and internally. The angular timber structure over a swimming pool in England creates a complex space above the calm surface of the water. A holiday home in Sweden is playfully closed at the top by a series of concrete gables, while the pyramidal roofs of a museum in Ahrenshoop, clad in irregularly folded brass sheeting, are reminiscent of the thatched houses in the area."

http://issuu.com/papress/docs/archigram_screen,ISSUU - Archigram by Princeton Architectural Press,13,"In late 1960, in various flats in Hampstead, a loose group of people started to meet: to criticize projects, to concoct letters to the press, to combine to make competition projects, and generally prop one another up against the boredom of working in a London architectural office. It became obvious that some publication would help. The main British magazines did not at that time publish student work, so that Archigram was reacting to this as well as the general sterility of the scene. The title came from a notion of a more urgent and simple item than a journal, like a &#x27;telegram&#x27; or &#x27;aerogramme,&#x27; hence &#x27;archi(tecture)-gram.&#x27;...By this time Peter Cook, David Greene, and Mike Webb, in making a broadsheet, had started a new Group."

Always trying to\nchallenge the older methodology is my constant pursuit. It could be seen that\neach project was influenced by certain software, especially in my early years,\nbecause I have been pushing myself work under different conditions - both\ndigital technology and hands-on crafts. However, I believe that the essence\nof architecture should not be overwhelmed by any tools we use in the design\nprocess. It will always emerge from what we see, what we think and what we\nmake."

We begin with a shared experience and approach to architecture, to help inform a foundation that may be carried forward into individual works, culminating in the collective MARS exhibition, summer 2014. Making lies at the heart of the studio as a way of thinking about and exploring architecture, this book, as an opening chapter to the year, represents the establishment of this ethos within Peter, Samuel and Michael. There is a shared understanding within the studio, that the act of production, be it a drawing, model or prototype, is an enriching and thoroughly useful mode of thinking. Making is therefore more than the conclusion of a process, but a feedback loop where ideas can be tested and decisions challenged, to ultimately inform built architecture."

I was constantly involved in projects that dealt with incremental scales of design in both urban and rural contexts. The studios involved synthesis between the built and unbuilt , landscapes and structural systems. \nAt Pratt Institute, I took this understanding forward  with experimentation with digital media, amalgamating new avenues of interdisciplinary learning with core design.The projects are a conscious effort to address an urban idea with architectural intervention.\nThis book is a brief attempt at exhibiting this entire process of architectural learning through selected projects which have greatly impacted in realigning my role  as a designer."

http://issuu.com/carleyfriesen/docs/ecologyofpublicurbanspace,ISSUU - The Ecology of Public Urban Space by Carley Friesen,3,"The underlying reason for this discourse is the belief that environmental crises (and therefore, economic and social crises) stems from the loss of a fundamental awareness of human within ecosystem.  That is to say; one&#x2019;s disconnectedness from ecological systems and his placement of self above the biosphere, is the reason why, despite technical innovations and the &#x2018;green movement&#x2019;, environmental catastrophe threatens to be the end of human.\n\nThis project uses Malm&#xF6;, a city striving for sustainability, as an example of how sustainable environmental design can be challanged to go beyond measurable success.  Urban design can be used to create an understanding of our position within the ecosystem.  Looking specifically at public space in Malm&#xF6;, the project uses the lens of ecology to discuss design which exposes ecological systems in daily life."

Lizenn Publishing previously published the first Architecture in Steel collection in 2013 and the second collection in 2014. Since this series was launched, the architecture industry has been inspired to design buildings and interiors using steel. Architects, engineers, and construction contractors have found assurance in the quality of projects that use steel in their design. The recent growth in the use of steel is clearly evident, and the number of new high quality projects utilizing steel components has inspired this latest collection."

The City of Kiruna is changing. The very reason for its existence, iron ore, is also the reason for its demise. By 2050 almost the entire City Centre, and a large amount of housing, will be lost to the deformations from the City&#x2019;s iron ore mine. A new City Centre must be developed to the East of the current one, safe from the effects of the mining."

http://issuu.com/magdahogness/docs/collaborativeconsumption,ISSUU - Collaborative Consumption  Toward Inclusive Public Participation in Design by Magdalena Hogness,3,"As we seek to regenerate postindustrial waterfronts for public use, public involvement in the design decision-making process must be defined.  These projects are inherently complex, with large infrastructure components, high cost, and technical constraints.  This work explores different models of public participation using case studies from the Copenhagen Harborfront and the Stockholm Waterfront to compare to the current Seattle Waterfront Design Process.  The case study comparison demonstrates that more effort is needed to establish the role of local knowledge in decision-making.   Drawing connections between the practice of user generated design and research on public participation models, I propose an alternative approach that might help us develop more responsible and responsive strategies for designing with the local community. I argue for the method of collaborative consumption&#x2212;a sedimentation of user-generated design to shape public places&#x2212;and I test this method on Pier 48."

This project seeks to capitalize on these major investments by creating a Harlem River Green way that connects the wide range of experiences of the Harlem River waterfront, from manicured to natural landscapes and from industrial to residential neighborhoods. The Greenway winds along the Harlem River through the Highbridge and Mott Haven neighborhoods. \n\nThe Bronx, Meet Your Waterfront plan presents strategies that reconnect the river to its adjacent communities. Eco-puncture, temporary activation, waterfront access, and infrastructure adaptability have been applied to specific sites as a comprehensive strategy to bring people to the waterfront."

My experience over the past eight years is reviewed here in brief.The diagrams illustrate how my ideas have developed through experimentation and process.From a viewpoint of &#x201C;interactive design,&#x201D; which gave birth to my thought processes, these cases of experimental design suggest that the concept of space design could be extended far beyond conventional boundaries. Thus interactive communication may be encouraged in a variety of fields thereby creating a fusion of disparate disciplines, which may previously have been considered to be irreconcilable."

Although the projects vary in nature, they do share something in common: that they either serve the general public or are semi-public community spaces operated by the government or non-profit making organizations. These include museum, school, church, clinic, rehabilitation centre and community centre. To call it &#x2018;Institutional SPACE&#x2019; may best suit its magnitude. The museum projects covered in this issue bring a broad perspective. It spans from major architectural reconfiguration to specific room design, exhibition layouts, display facilities, and down to signages, lighting, display items and allocation of audio-visual systems. Besides the museum/gallery in the first section, other projects are put together according to their spatial nature for readers&#x2019; reference and comparison."

This mediation takes place on multiple levels &#x2013; within the building industry, between public, clients and designers, and between public, clients and designers, and between the actual design and its environment. To achieve this, the field of work, the tools of design and the representation of architects needs to develop. The architect has to design the design process itself. Mediating Architecture demonstrates the extended role of the architect through the applied work of AA&#x27;s Diploma Unit 14 within London&#x27;s Thames Gateway over three consecutive years. A series of essays reflect this methodology from the multi-disciplinary perspectives of architecture, urban design, landscape design and philosophy."

The innate nature of many ephemeral interventions draws upon the participation and engagement of the public. This is an exploratory process into the problematic relationship of residual space as voids of underutilized potential within the urban fabric and seeks to establish an architectural precedent for dealing with these spaces in an ephemeral and reactionary manor. Using ephemeral interventions, participatory events and responsive components, attention can be brought upon residual spaces, inviting occupation, development and reconsideration with the intention of filling the voids within the urban fabric and creating more continuity within the modern city. Utilizing these strategies, a 21st century cultural center can be created that evolves, adapts and reacts to the mass will of the public over the whims of a single curator."

The freefall of the economy leaves vacant space and spurs inventive reclamation through collective action. Drastic environmental transformation forces new paradigms of building, thinking, and living. What will be the character of space that emerges from this instability? How can design tactics initiate succession of under-used space? How do we represent process and temporality over traditional determinism? How long is temporary? Facing uncertainty in the landscape, how do we adjust our way of thinking to move past merely physical proposals to more open-ended operational strategies?"

However, once inside the megalomaniac building there was a softness, an architectural softness. A softness that is so characteristic of his work. This play with light, the unexpected light, has made a big impression on me, far away in India.\nLater on I visited Notre-Dame-du-Haut, Villa Savoye and maison La Roche. Never as a series, always separately."

http://issuu.com/ar.mborkar/docs/design_samples,ISSUU - Design samples by Mamta Borkar,1,"Hi! I am an architect and interior designer. My strengths lie in my varied background and the experiences and skill-set I have developed through them. I have worked as an architect, interior designer and a design strategist. All different but uniquely connected in their process. I am curious about how buildings, technology, and environment seem independent but codependent on each other. Their co-existence defines the fundamentals of the integrated design process, an underlying attribute of sustainable design. I love understanding and reinventing the concepts of the triple bottom line applied to the built environment to enrich the user experience. This portfolio provides a small yet significant insight into my expertise and skills in the field of design integration, strategic planning and management and project execution. Enjoy!"

I get to introduce the amazing work of our final year MArch students. I am so proud of what they have achieved at the end of their studies on the MArch programme. They have done so through their own talent and hard work, skilfully channelled, directed and challenged by the tutors who work in and with the School.\n\nThe diversity of topics on offer across the seven units has allowed the students to develop a rich set of skills they can put to immediate use in architectural practice. At the WSA we promote a creative pragmatism that balances strong conceptual design with a commitment to realising this work in practice. As one student said to an external examiner, the School is &#x201C;exploratory but grounded.&#x201D;\n\nThe future of architecture lies with these young women and men. When you see their work, I think you&#x2019;ll agree we are in safe hands.\n\nProfessor Chris Tweed\nHead of School"

The hope of this is to let new architecture define itself for what it is within the fabric, rather than designing something that&#x2019;s primary goal is to look 100 years older than it is. The goal of this would be to promote growth back to the center where the identity of the city is defined, but economic density has left for the big box stores only promoting their own identity on the outskirts of the city."

They inform the designers of the intent behind the plan and are purposefully written to encourage interpretation.

By throwing out the tenets of Modernism, the whimsical novelty of their fanciful creations has enchanted a public bored with efficiency and logic.  The time has come to point out that these emperors of Mannerism wear no clothes, and to agitate for some discussion about where this architectural trend is taking us."

The concept is based on the idea of creating an architecture that respects the idea of vernacular buildings by avoiding a single form in favour of an assemblage of smaller elements, akin to the typology of farm buildings. The house therefore divides into three functions; guest/study; living; and sleeping. These are used to create three interlocking forms that are clad in cedar above a white wall. A central chimney anchors the composition and rises above a black zinc roof that echoes traditional slate."

This paper deals with the contrast in\nthe way of treating people based on their skin complexion, hair style, way of carrying themselves and other external\ndisplays of beauty as depicted by Gwendolyn Brooks in her novel Maud Martha. This book is the only work of fiction\nwritten by Gwendolyn Brooks, the great Pulitzer Prize winning poet.\nThis study reveals the way in which Gwendolyn Brooks has torn apart the traditional black family customs of a\nwoman feeling closer to only domestic activities and men concerned about finance and decision making. The author\nemphasizes the thought about being self-determined and independent about their respective thought process.\nAccording to Kent, the story line revolves around Maud Martha Brown a black woman who is subjected to bad\ntreatment by the society merely due to her colour.

Students discuss the relationship of City Center to its immediate context and whether the appropriate materials and design decisions were made when taking the context into consideration. Sustainable design and construction, eco development, technology, mathematics, color and texture, and computation in architecture are some other topics that enter the discussion. \rIn addition students compared City Center Las Vegas to multiple precedents that share the same goals and intentions. Each project&#x2019;s location, concept, program, and functional requirements will be discussed and critically analyzed. This becomes a study and discussion of mixed-use spaces, relationships to their context, user experience, and what determines the success and failure of projects within the same category and scale."

Nature has given us the basic building blocks to create more harmonious environments for ourselves. If we apply what we observe from nature into our own urban environments we have an opportunity to reduce urban sprawl, reduce stress on infrastructure, reduce overall pollution, and increase the quality of life for ourselves and our community."

Tracy Hill investigates the idea that our negotiation of data and reference points often brings with it a sense of dislocation and fragmentation and how identification with our senses enables a deeper awareness and understanding.\nBy adopting commercial mapping technology and combining it with traditional handmade processes an aesthetic is reintroduced to the digital seeking to offer a re-imagined perspective of spaces which maybe we have forgotten to see."

Their dominant presence formed and altered existing boundaries in the little village. Our workshop became a laboratory of tools, patterns and interventions and a microcosm of border production and change."

Before that I worked with Arx New York, Per-forma Studio and firms in Middle East. My approach to architectural design is seeing it as an interdisciplinary activity for social and cultural change. Along with professional practice I have continued my research through teaching at Columbia GSAPP and Pratt institute. My area of specialty and interest that I have developed is performative/responsive systems. In different projects, using tools such as Rhino Grasshopper, Revit and further integration with other programs, mainly Ecotect Analysis, has been a big asset for me and helped me to develop and optimize building performance especially in facades and roofing systems and detailing it. \nMore information: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mazdak-jafarian/18/b46/bb9"

The contemporary built environment is managed and influenced by data both visible and hidden. A wealth of information is now collected and stored from every aspect of our daily lives. Architects and designers are increasingly aware of the potential of data. It is now possible to collect and synthesize data to draw conclusions that allow one to make urban design and architectural decisions. This thesis proposes a development approach that uses data to design a mixed-use building in Seattle as a solution for increased density and population growth in the year 2050.

Wright&#x2019;s relentless pursuit of this principle in uncompromising architectural\nform involved strong sacrifices and an unconventional environment for its inhabitants. The purpose of this paper is to explore the Jacobs house from a material culture standpoint, extending E. McClung Fleming&#x2019;s model for artifact study, which was developed primarily for early American decorative arts but is being extended into architecture here."
